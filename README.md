# Audible_Data_Analysis


üìùINTRODUCTION

   In recent years, the audiobook industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing         segments of the digital content market. With the increasing popularity of platforms       such as Audible, Google Play Books, and Storytel, more readers are choosing to listen     rather than read, leading to a major transformation in how literature is consumed.        Audiobooks offer the convenience of multitasking ‚Äî enabling users to enjoy stories,       educational content, and professional development material anytime and anywhere.

The Audible Dataset provides valuable insights into this evolving market by capturing key information about audiobooks released between 1998 and 2025 (including pre-planned releases). It contains attributes such as:
    
    * Title of the audiobook

    * Author and Narrator details

    * Language and Release Date

    * Price, Star Rating, and Total Ratings
    
   Through this dataset, we can explore how the audiobook market has developed over the years, what trends define its growth, and how factors such as author popularity, narration quality, price, and ratings influence listener preferences.

üîπOBJECTIVES

  1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation ‚Äì Handle missing, inconsistent, or noisy data for reliable analysis.

  2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Understand data distribution, identify relationships among variables, and summarize key statistics.

  3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization ‚Äì Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create informative visuals such as bar charts, heatmaps, treemaps, and scatter plots.

  4Ô∏è‚É£ Insight Generation ‚Äì Interpret patterns and relationships between variables like Star Rating, Price, Language, Author, and Release Year.

üéØAim of the Project

   The main aim of this analysis is to explore and understand trends, patterns, and insights in the audiobook market using the Audible dataset, which contains         details of audiobooks released between 1998 and 2025. This includes analyzing how the audiobook industry has evolved over time, identifying key factors             influencing its growth, and uncovering patterns in author activity, genres, ratings, and release trends.


üîπ Key Steps in the Project 

    Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.
    Removed duplicates.
    Handled missing values.
    Datatype of columns changed as per values.
    Calculated mean value for null handling to handle outliers and maintain data integrity.
    provide values to upper case.
    Added space between the words.
    Removed unwanted words in the column.
    Column splitting.
    Rounding the decimal values.
    Columns were renamed for readability.
    Calculated derived columns.

üîπ Visualizations Used

  To explore the data from multiple angles, the following charts were used:

  Bar Plot - Compare averages between groups

  Histogram - Show distribution of numeric dat

  Pie Chart - Show proportions of categories

  Box Plot - Display spread and outliers

  Scatter Plot - Show relationship between two numeric variables

  Heatmap - Display correlations or group averages

  Violin - Show detailed data distributions

  Line Chart - Show trends (e.g., claim vs. age)

  Pair Plot - Visualize relationships between multiple variables

  Stacked Bar Plot -compare total values across categories

  Boxen Plot - Compare distributions

  Treemap - Display hierarchical data using nested rectangles

  Donut Chart - compare proportions of categories in a circular format


üîπ Key Findings / Insights 

  High Quality: Most audiobooks receive above-average ratings (4‚òÖ+).

  Language Trend: English dominates, but other languages are growing slowly.

  Duration Preference: Listeners prefer medium-length audiobooks (4‚Äì10 hours).

  Top Performers: Some authors and narrators consistently achieve 4.8‚òÖ+ ratings.

  Growth Pattern: Audiobook releases grew sharply after 2015 ‚Äî reflecting digital content expansion.

  Popularity Correlation: Higher total ratings correspond to better star ratings, but not always proportionally.

  Listener Behavior: Short, engaging, well-narrated content receives the best feedback.

üîπ Overall Insights

   The audiobook market is growing steadily, with increasing diversity in genres, authors, and languages.

  High ratings indicate strong consumer satisfaction and trust in major authors/narrators.

  English titles dominate the platform, but non-English markets show room for expansion.

 Price and popularity have a weak-to-moderate relationship ‚Äî suggesting that brand value matters more than price.

 The dataset supports the observation that digital storytelling is a thriving market heading into 2025.
